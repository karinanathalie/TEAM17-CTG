# ZUBIN WEB 2.0 (TEAM17-CTG)

## Project Overview
This project comprises three main products, each designed to serve distinct user groups and streamline operations efficiently:

### 1. Participants and Volunteers Facing Webpage
- **Purpose:** A user-friendly interface designed to engage participants and volunteers. It offers easy access to event information, registration forms, schedules, and other relevant resources.
- **Features:** 
  - Interactive event calendar
  - Registration and application forms for participants and volunteers
  - Access to essential resources and updates

### 2. Admin Facing Webpage
- **Purpose:** A comprehensive administrative portal that centralizes all critical operations, enabling efficient management of events, communications, and analytics.
- **Features:** 
  - **Analytics Dashboard:** Provides insights into participant engagement, event metrics, and volunteer contributions.
  - **Application Management:** Streamlined process for reviewing and managing submissions.
  - **Mass Communication:** Tools for sending bulk WhatsApp messages and emails to participants and volunteers.
  - **Event Management:** Tools for organizing and managing event details, participants, and logistics.

### 3. Continuous Learning Chatbot
- **Purpose:** An AI-powered chatbot integrated into the public-facing webpage to assist web visitors. The chatbot is designed to learn continuously, improving its responses based on interactions and the Zubin Foundation programâ€™s information.
- **Features:** 
  - Real-time assistance for website visitors
  - Continuous learning capabilities to enhance user interaction over time
  - Knowledge base grounded in the Zubin Foundation program

### Technical Architecture
- **Webpages:** The project includes two webpages: one for public access (participants and volunteers) and one for admin use.
- **Backend:** Both webpages are powered by the same backend built using the Django framework.
- **Hosting:** The entire application is hosted in a Docker container with restrictive access to ensure security and reliability.
